## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

i tried to make this project more realistic not just an example so  i used travel concept  to be my landing page project
i applied html  codes as 
1- i created div to add all image before sections also i applied the size for  images  to make them all have same size 
2- i used span element to make paragraph organized with images also i add id to each element to be able later to control them by css
3-i add data on each paragraph
4-finally i linked the javascript file with html by <script> code at the bottom in order to work fine 
5-i add section 4 by html

i applied some javascript codes:
1- i used queryselector to make nav-bar linked to anchor that i created for item 
2- i have to make anchor for each item because they all different and each one has unique id 
3- i add images(flag) to each anchor with its size 
4- i used insertAdjacentHTML method to make link between anchor and nav-bar
5-I tried to apply observer intersection method to customized clicked section but it didn’t work I appreciate if you show me how to do it because I watched a lot of videos but still couldn’t get it 
  


i applied some css codes:
1- i make every item in nav-bar has his own color and image also i amake them have same size 
2- i used text-decoration method to remove the underline from anchor link 
3-i applied margin method to control distance and directions between the elements
4- i applied hover method to make item more visible when you move mouse on it 
5- i applied html scroll method to feel page work smoothly
6- i make all the images that appears before section have same size by getting them under the same class
7- i used performance method to check efficiency of my page
